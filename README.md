This plugin allows power counters to be connected to elevators, to display the lift's current floor, and to function as a call button.

No permissions, configuration or localization.

## How it works

Use a wire tool to connect the "Passthrough" output of a power counter to an elevator's "Call Elevator" input. While the elevator is powered, the counter will automatically have power and display the lift's current floor, even as the lift moves. Interacting with the counter will also function as a call button, sending the lift floor where the counter is connected.

Note: Connecting a wire to the counter's power input will cause it to function like a normal counter, in case players want to use it as such.
